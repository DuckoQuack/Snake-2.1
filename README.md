In order for this to work, you will need Python 3 or above, you will also need to download pygame if you have not already. To download pygame, open command prompt and type "pip install pygame". After you have done this, the game should launch and(hopefully) have worked. If it still doesn't launch, try typing "pip3 install pygame" then try it. Please report any other issues or ideas for this game by contacting me at mgideon24d@gmail.com. If you have read this whole thing, thanks, I usually don't read the readme's.
